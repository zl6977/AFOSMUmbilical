INTRODUCTION
The package containing the four py files can generate the Siemens NX Knowledge Fusion code (DFA file) for a parametric model of umbilical cable.
1. UC_package.py: umbilical cable base class, containing 
2. AFOSM_UC_package.py: based on UC_package.py, a class for AFOSM is set.
3. MonteCarlo_UC_package.py: based on UC_package.py, some functions for MonteCarlo are added.
4. CalcGenerateDFA.py: generate the DFA file containing the reliability result automatically calculated by calling AFOSM_UC_package and MonteCarlo_UC_package
5. helix_curve_zzz.dfa: to provide the helix curve class

USAGE
Check CalcGenerateDFA.py, modify the parameters, and run it.
Then a Umbilical_AutoGenerated.dfa file will be generated.
Load the DFA file(together with helix_curve_zzz.dfa) in Siemens NX Knowledge Fusion module.
